# Overview

As a Software Engineer, I do my best to learn the fundamental skills in software development. I have come from a background wherein I learned Front End Development with React initially. This project helped learn Software Development by using Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS

KoRa's Treats is a web app that I created initially to highlight my fiancee's passion in baking. You can start the website using Live Server. I used SCSS as the CSS Preprocessor for the styling. I created this project to be able to highlight some skills that I can use when I contact small business owner about developing their own business websites.

The purppose of this software is to further my knowledge in fundamental Software Development such as DOM Manipulation, styling, and developing in JavaScript without any frameworks.

# Web Pages

* Home Page - It highlights all of the products from KoRa's Treats. It makes use of grid and flexbox layouting. There are simple animations during hover on the navigation bar and the products bar.
* Products Page - It shows all of the products from KoRa's treats. It makes use of grid and overflow-x to scroll horizontally and view all of the products.
* Contact Us Page - The review section is similar to the products page. As of now, the links are placeholders. However, I will update the link in the future if my fiancee decides to make it her own business .
